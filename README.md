A modpack for the current version of Minecraft, built on the Fabric modloader in order to make updating to newer versions of the game less painful. We strive to keep the game fun and relevant, while still being accessible to most types of players. The pack is built to be compatible with any type of shader mods, but is not tested with Canvas. It is primarily tested with Optifine (G6) and Optifabric.
