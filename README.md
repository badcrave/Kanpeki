A modpack for the current version of Minecraft, built on the Fabric modloader in order to make updating to newer versions of the game less painful. We strive to keep the game fun and relevant, while still being accessible to most types of players. The pack is built to be OptiFine compatible, but it should also work with other types of shader mods. Both Optifine and OptiFabric must be installed in your Kanpeki instance if you wish to use them. 

# The Official Kanpeki SMP

Our private SMP is a unique and exciting way to experience modded survival Minecraft and create experiences that would be impossible elsewhere and with new friends! When you support me on Patreon, I will thank you with access to the Kanpeki SMP and member-only channels on the Kanpeki Discord. [See this post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/getting-started-49655292) for more information about joining our SMP! You are encouraged to live-stream from the SMP if that's what you want to do. If you want to create unique minigames, explore and trade, or just build with some new friends, then we want you to come join us on our wonderful little server!

# Bugs & Other Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues with the pack, you can open an issue here on the github, and in order to get my attention faster you can send a message to the channel #bugs-and-issues on the [Kanpeki Discord](https://discord.gg/9qJqG9nvN3). This includes issues related to trying to use shader mods or other optimization mods, or problems with anything within the pack. Just let us know what you're experiencing and try to give us as much detail as possible!
